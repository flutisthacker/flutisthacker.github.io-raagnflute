## Hindi
### तेरे जुल्फो को देखु तो उस्मे एक गज्र लगने क दिल कर्त है
### तेरे आखोन मे देखु तो उस्मे मुझे प्यार क मन्जिल दिखै देत है
### तेरे हूथोन को क्षुलु तो उस्मे इशक क खुस्बू आत है
### तेरे हाथ को थम लु तो उस्मे मेरि दिल दिखऐ देता है

    - तिम्रो मुहर मेरो घाउ को लगि मल्हम हो
    - तिम्रो बोलि मेरो कान को लगि सुरिलो धुन
    - त्यो सुरिलो आवज सुनेको दिन गन्दै बर्सौ भो
    - आब यो घाउ सेलौन तिमि सम्झिदै हेर्च्हु आकश को जुन

 - when i see your eyes it feels like, i'm looking back into my heart
 - now that we've met each other, it still feels like we have never been apart
 - i waved at you, I think you were in a shock
 - my heart's open for you please don't knock
 - its's like a recurring dream I look at you and I shy away
 - what could i change in me to be with you and pave a way
 - You roamed around here and there, left and right
 - I wanted to follow you and then hold you tight
 - you were drunk and i didn't felt sober
 - one touch of your hand and it felt like it wasn't over
 - The warmth of you hand just spread over me lie a virus
 - A jolt of lightning ran through my body and i believe you are my iris

- how would you not feel jealous when someone is living your dream
- wouldn't your body and mind shout out and bloody scream
- knowing that you could never achieve what they have
- Feeling the heart draining out and leaving a gap
- I tried giving it my best, maybe i wasn't skillfull enough
- flying high up like icarus and falling to the depth was a bit rough
- how could I love you knowinf I would let you down
- Ignoring things and living live like a fucking clown
- how would I feel well when i am not even myself
- Needing both emotional support and mental help
- how would i accept something I deel i dont deserve
- would rather say NO and watch the smile i have preserved
- why don't I feel happy when they are having a good time
- thinking others would understand and performing some kind of mime
- just like joker, hanging by a thread; there is my sanity
- trying to be sane and living under this cruel humanity
- every time i say no something changes within me
- Should I accept the darkness and let it be a fantsy

- the dream that i had seen was sort of my chocolate dream
- I would want to be the sleeping beast rather than wake up
- she was just right there with me without any make up
- she smiled, we laughed, we had a bit of talk
- even though it was a few stps, I would call that a lovely walk
- all those scenary I had seen was just a dam lie deception of nature maker
- what would have happened, if she saw her picture as my wallpaper
- in the dream, i searched for a place where we could be together
- but now i realize that the dream was the only plave for that angel and her wing's feather
- to say the truth i didn't even sllept more than few hours
- but the dream I saw made me energized, full of mystical power
- IN the dream, it felt like yoyu wanted to be with me
- so why can't the reality and dream switch palces as a true wish to be
- at last i think she felt a bit sad when i didn't reached out to her
- So it was the reality that pulled me out of there
- genjitsu was kanojo wa watashi no aaoi sora
- mom ko ra usko smile dekhna payeko bhagyamani mora
